# LinkedList-ADT-with-Array
Trying to make a singly linked list without using pointers for the "next" node in the list. Using only a structure for a Node with a short item and an integer vale for the next node's address in the array. So the array is, basically an array of nodes. This array also has a "free" list which is in the same array. This free list contains nothing for the item values but each node in this "part of the array" has addresses of the next free nodes. Whenever a new value has to be added one of the free nodes is used. When a value is deleted, the used nodes then gets added to the free nodes.
